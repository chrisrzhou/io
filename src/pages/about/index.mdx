## Manifesto

Information/data is all around us. I enjoy transforming data into simple delightful interfaces, empowering human workflows and experiences in an increasingly dehumanized (machinized) world.

I wish to contribute towards an open and cheap future, where everyone can solve higher-order challenges without struggling with lower-order problems. I see the beauty in code as a way to engineer solutions and build an evolving platform for collaboration.

I believe that the choices we make matter more than the goals we seek. They reflect our principles, beliefs and values on how we conduct ourselves and the work we create.

## Interests

Most of my projects touch on the following interest areas:

<CodeTokenList values={resume.interests} />

## Tools

As a hack-of-all-trades, I am unopinionated about tools and utilize what is best for the task. I have used the following tools effectively in past projects:

<CodeTokenList values={resume.skills} />

## Influences

My approach of building simple, cheap and quality interfaces are largely inspired by the following people:
