## Manifesto

Information (data) is all around us. It gives meaning to relevant parties, and power to irrelevant parties. I focus on using information for good and transform it into meaningful experiences for everyone.

I work towards building a cheap and open future, where everyone is solving higher-order challenges without struggling with lower-order problems.

I value choices over outcomes, as it reflects our priorities, principles and relationships with others. I believe it is important to augment human experiences in an age of digital consumerism that is eroding the human identity.

## Interests

Most of my work touch on the following broad interests:
`data`, `visualization`, `ui`, `ux`, `design-system`, `open-source`, `automation`,

and other specific interests:
`jamstack`, `component-library`, `markdown`, `cheap-ui`, `progressive-documentation`, `genetic-algorithms`.

## Tools

As a hack-of-all-trades, I am unopinionated about tools and use what is best for the task.

I have used the following tools to effectively transport/transform/render data in projects: `react`, `redux`, `graphql`, `d3`, `three`, `gatsby`, `netlify`, `jest`, `cypress`, `typescript`, `flow`, `python`, `sql`, `markdown`
