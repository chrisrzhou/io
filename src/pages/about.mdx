## Manifesto

Information/data is all around us. I enjoy building interfaces to transform data into meaningful experiences.

I wish to contribute towards an open and cheap future, where everyone can solve higher-order challenges without struggling with lower-order problems.

I believe that the choices we make matter more than the goals we seek. They reflect our principles, beliefs and values on how we conduct ourselves and the work we create.

## Interests

Most of my projects touch on the following broad areas:
`data`, `visualization`, `ui`, `ux`, `open-source`, `automation`, `design-system`,

and other specific topics such as:
`jamstack`, `component-library`, `markdown`, `cheap-ui`, `progressive-documentation`, `genetic-algorithms`.

## Tools

As a hack-of-all-trades, I am unopinionated about tools and utilize what is best for the task. I have used the following tools effectively in past projects: `react`, `redux`, `graphql`, `d3`, `three`, `gatsby`, `netlify`, `typescript`, `flow`, `markdown`, `jest`, `cypress`, `python`, `sql`.

## Influences

My approach of building simple, cheap and quality interfaces are largely inspired by the following people: [@jxnblk](https://jxnblk.com/), [@ramaworks](https://rama.works/), [@mbostock](https://github.com/mbostock), [@gaearon](https://github.com/gaearon), [@xxiivv](https://xxiivv.com/).
