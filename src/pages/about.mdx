## Manifesto

Information/data is all around us. I enjoy building tools to transform data into meaningful experiences for everyone.

I seek to build an open and cheap future, where everyone can solve higher-order challenges together without struggling with lower-order problems.

I believe that the choices we make matter more than the goals we seek. I value opinions and conflicts to continue to refine myself and the experiences we will build together.

## Interests

Most of my work touch on the following broad areas:
`data`, `visualization`, `ui`, `ux`, `design-system`, `open-source`, `automation`,

and other specific areas:
`jamstack`, `component-library`, `markdown`, `cheap-ui`, `progressive-documentation`, `genetic-algorithms`.

## Tools

As a hack-of-all-trades, I am unopinionated about tools and use what is best for the task.

I have used the following tools effectively tranform and render data in past projects: `react`, `redux`, `graphql`, `d3`, `three`, `gatsby`, `netlify`, `jest`, `cypress`, `typescript`, `flow`, `python`, `sql`, `markdown`.

## Influences

I seek to constantly learn and gain mastery over what I do not know, allowing me to build simple and quality experiences for others.

I draw my inspirations heavily from the following people: [@jxnblk](https://jxnblk.com/), [@ramaworks](https://rama.works/), [@mbostock](https://github.com/mbostock), [@gaearon](https://github.com/gaearon), [@xxiivv](https://xxiivv.com/).
