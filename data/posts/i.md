# I

This microstory presents a thought experiment when traveling and seeing oneself at the other end of the [wormhole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wormhole).

Who am I? Who is the real me? Are we both 'me'? Is the question valid in the first place? If you have solidifed a viewpoint, feel free to read the [palindromic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome) story backwards or invert the perspective of the subject falling/emerging through the wormhole.

Inspired by ideas from [I am a Strange Loop](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL8067922W) and [Reasons and Persons](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL3153831W).

I am Chris.

Who am I?

I see a partial reflection of myself…

Staring back at me on the other end…

My consciousness fades in and out…

As I continue to fall through the wormhole…

As I continue to fall through the wormhole…

My consciousness fades in and out…

Staring back at me on the other end…

I see a partial reflection of myself…

Who am I?

I am Chris.
