They are luxuries. I do not believe in luxuries. Do I reserve for myself the freedom to I deny to others? I do not. I sit here within my cage and I am but a servant, who am master of all that I see. I see desolation. I see ashes. I have so very much. I have so very little. I am not loved. I know that. Not in soul or body. I have never known the soft whisper of endearment.
