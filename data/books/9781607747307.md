Decluttering your life goes beyond the physical act of tidying up. It creates a constant **dialogue** between the things you own and is a **reflection** of how you want to live your life with positivity and joy.

As you discard various items, you revisit and respect them for how they have played a role in who you were (instead of simply stashing them in hidden corners). As you keep various items, you reflect on why they are important in your life and who you are becoming.

This lesson extends into decluttering our mind as we take time in our busy lives to organize and reflect on who we are and are becoming. By having a constant dialogue with yourself on understanding and dropping negative emotions and embracing positive emotions, we are able to move forward in the present and future more confidently.
